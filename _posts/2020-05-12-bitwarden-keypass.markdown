# Summary

I have been a long time Keepass user, recently looking at Bitwarden following some recommendations.

These are my thoughts. (Notes for now, will add details over time)

# Bitwarden

## Pro

* cool look.
* integrations with Andriod / Windows.

## Con

Compared to Keepass, Bitwarden falls short in:

* shortcut keys:
  * quick launch CTRL-ALT-K to launch, CTRL-E to get to edit.
  * search in password fields for pattern.
  * form fill: In Keepass, matching defaults are pre-inserted into user/pass login fields, in Bitwarden I still need to mouse all the way up to top-right of browser and click the Bitwarden icon and then click the matching entry.
  * Auto-type, CTRL-V in Keepass will auto-type the user password into the login page.
